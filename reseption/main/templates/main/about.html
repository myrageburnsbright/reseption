    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      We started Furnibuild with a simple belief: great spaces begin with pieces
      that are built to last and designed to be remembered. From intimate home
      bars to high‑volume hospitality venues, we combine modern engineering with
      old‑world craftsmanship to deliver furniture that performs as beautifully
      as it looks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every project is guided by three principles—precision, honest materials,
      and service that respects your timeline and budget.
