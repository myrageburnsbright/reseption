    cookie banner or preferences center. Disabling certain cookies may affect

  <h2>International Data Transfers</h2>

  </p>
  <h2>Data Retention</h2>
  <p>
    We keep personal data only as long as necessary for the purposes described
    above, including fulfilling orders, warranties, resolving disputes, and

    and invoices 7–10 years; account data until deletion; marketing preferences
    until you opt out.
  </p>
  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>
    We implement administrative, technical, and physical measures to protect
    personal data. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure; we
    cannot guarantee absolute security.
  </p>
  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Our services are not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly
    collect personal information from them. If you believe a child has provided
    us personal data, contact us and we will take appropriate action. For
    EEA/UK, the age threshold may be 16 depending on local law.
  </p>
  <h2>Your Rights</h2>
  <p>

    correct, delete, restrict, or object to processing, and to data portability.

  <h2>Do Not Track</h2>

    standard, we do not respond to DNT signals.
